Why can designing for the experience be one of the most powerful opportunity of our age?Imagine that we are traveling to the other side of the world for a business trip, and at the arrival we are without our smartphone, our personal assistant in this digital age.

> How does it feel?

Personally I have experienced this kind of situation sometimes in my life and every time it was so stressful without my phone. Last year when I went to Hong kong for few days I lived exactly that situation.I landed, wait for few minutes for reach the terminal, switched on my phone to check my plan and directions and...**the screen remained black. Dead. Silent**. Out of battery. So, how could I reach my hotel?I had to find a way out of the airport. I remembered the hotel name and I tried to look for the exit inside the airport, and the direction was clear.

I moved towards the exit. I grabbed my bag. I easily passed the customs. I reached the train station.

I type my Hotel name into the display of the ticket machine and it says: "To reach your hotel go to the central station with the rapid train and catch the double-decker. Do you want a prepaid city card for the next days?"

I swiped my credit card and I received an rfid card with 100$ for use in all the public transportation, local shops, and a map of the city. I got on the train. I relaxed looking the city skyline with a nice music in background.

I reached the train station just in front the trams station. I brought the double-decker trams for two stop to reach my hotel. And finally I checked in in the hotel, and when I walked into my room I found a really nice welcome kit and a ready to use charger â˜º

> Nothing horrible happened to me.

In fact, my journey from the airport to my hotel was a real pleasure and allowed me to enjoy Hong Kong.

The airport halls were full of beautiful local artworks that gave me a taste of the the city, and empathize with the local mood. When I bought the ticket for the train I was given a prepaid card which allowed me to access the whole local transport system and use in local shops like credit card. On my way to the train I was comforted by a lot of signals and information that gently rocked me since i got on the train.

I've never felt lonely, or abandoned, or lost. No stress, no anxiety.

Everything in this trip was**transparent, fluid, easy, smooth, pleasant**. It allowed me to focus on the city, without burdening me with the stress of orienting in a strange land.

> But here's the point: why was this experience so relevant for me?Why it was so memorable?And why it changed my future expectation when I travel?

Being a designer, I assume that the reason why is because**someone has designed and orchestrate every single interaction I find on the path**, with things, services, systems, places and means of transportation so that I could live a good experience. The**context enabled me to focus my attention to my life**and the outside world.

The experiences that we live are some of the[most important elements in our life][0].

Experiences define how we feel, our happiness, our expectations and the way as we behave.

The quality of the experience we live, defines the quality of our life. So,**enabling people to live good experiences, today, is one of the most interesting challenges for design**.

Design and designers, more than any other discipline and professionals, have the power to empathize and understand how people live and feel experiences in different contexts and how consumers relate with the different technologies.

Based on what we understand, we are moving our discipline from simply creating useful and beautiful products, to create synergies between physical, digital and cultural context in order to generate new spaces for interaction.

Working on the spaces where people interact with each other, with complex systems and services, enable us to**shape the places where experience originate into a simpler, smoother, more pleasant and beautiful way**.

And my trip in Hong Kong made of connected devices, automated transportations, smart objects, multi-channel services is a good case: all these new spaces for interaction are few examples of this new approach.

> Today's designer are shifting their focus from designing products and services for human, to design for the human experience, and this is one of the biggest opportunity for this age:**improve people life by improving the experience they live as human, citizen and customers**.
